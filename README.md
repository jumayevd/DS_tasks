# Contest

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates essential features and capabilities of Python, such as modularity, dynamic typing, and functional programming. Each task is implemented as a separate Python script to highlight Python's versatility and clean code practices.

### **Task 1: Handling Arbitrary Named Arguments**
**Function Name:** `kwargsAcceptFun`  
**Description:**  
This function accepts an arbitrary number of named arguments (also known as keyword arguments). It uses the `**kwargs` syntax to gather the arguments into a dictionary. The function then returns the dictionary with the key-value pairs.

### **Task 2: Type-Based Transformation**
**Function Name:** `typeBasedTransformer`  
**Description:**  
This function accepts an arbitrary number of named arguments and processes each value based on its type.

### **Task 3: Function Execution Time Decorator**
**Function Name:** `decorator_1`  
**Description:**  
This function decorator calculates and prints the execution time of any function it wraps. The decorator uses the time.perf_counter() method to measure precise time intervals, and prints the time taken for the function to execute.
